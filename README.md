Easy EV
Easy EV is a Python-based analytical model designed to enhance the accuracy of electric vehicle (EV) charging demand predictions and optimize the placement of EV charging stations. This project was part of the Experience Expo 2024 Summer at Northeastern University, featuring a collaboration with Puget Sound Energy.

Features
Enhanced EV Charging Demand Predictions: Improved prediction accuracy by integrating diverse data sources like US Census and Open Street Maps.
GIS Tools for Spatial Analysis: Implemented GIS tools to manipulate spatial data, which helped identify high-priority infrastructure areas and reduced analysis time.
Data-Driven Infrastructure Optimization: Collaborated with stakeholders to apply statistical models, optimizing the placement of EV charging stations and contributing to more informed infrastructure expansion decisions.
Technologies Used
Python: Core language used for developing the analytical model.
GIS Tools: Used for spatial data manipulation to identify key areas for infrastructure development.
Matplotlib: Employed for creating visualizations that support data analysis and decision-making.
US Census Data: Integrated as a key data source for demographic and geographic information.
Open Street Maps (OSM): Utilized for detailed spatial data to inform infrastructure planning.
Usage
This project can be used to:

Analyze and predict EV charging demand based on integrated geographic and demographic data.
Identify high-priority areas for the placement of EV charging stations using spatial analysis.
Generate visualizations to support data-driven decisions in infrastructure planning.
